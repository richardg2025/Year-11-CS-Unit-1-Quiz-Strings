Inside the main method …

1. Declare and initialize a variable of type int called age to a value of 33.
2. Declare and initialize a variable of type String called name to a value of T Swizzle.
3. Print out the variable age using a single println statement. 
4. Print out the variable name using the println statement.
5. Declare and initialize a variable of type String called description to a value of My name is T Swizzle and I am 33 years old. Make sure to use the variables age and name in this String. That is, you must use String concatenation. Do not hardcode the values T Swizzle and 33.
6. Print out the variable description using a single println statement. 
7. Use the length method in the String class to print out the length of the description.
8. Use the substring method to capture the String “T Swizzle” within description. Store this in a variable called nameSubDescription.
9. Use the substring method to capture the String “33” within description. Store this in a variable of type int called ageSubDescription. You will need to convert this value to an integer. Use Integer.parseInt(insert string here). Do this in a single statement. 
10. Declare and initialize a variable of type String called subDescription to a value of My name is T Swizzle and I am 33 years old. Make sure to use the variables ageSubDescription and nameSubDescription in this String. That is, you must use String concatenation. Do not hardcode the values T Swizzle and 33.
